title: Exploring LibreNMS
---

Today I'm going to have a look at LibreNMS. It's a network monitoring, managing and auditing tool that looks quite interesting and is slowly building up a community.

I'm going to run it on Claudio, which may get crowded - it already hosts this blog, a private Snipe-IT instance, and hopefully LibreNMS + NetBox.

netbox is awesome - I'm hoping to set it up for personal use and document my cloud servers and Wings Lab, but more on that in some other post.

I'm not sure where LibreNMS ends and netbox begins in terms of functionality. I know there will be some overlap.

My primary interests in LibreNMS are:
* Discovering and monitoring websites
* General service and network monitoring
* Keeping track of needed package updates
* General auditing
