title: Open Infrastructure

Security by obscurity.

As much as we hate it, as much as we try to avoid it, most of us rely on it more than we should.

You may notice that this blog and the content and code used to generate it are [open-source](https://github.com/Zorlin/raptorswithhats.com). Similarly, you may see me refer to my personal infrastructure in detail on this blog. For example, as of this writing, this blog is generated by Jekyll and then served by nginx on a Ubuntu 16.04 box named "claudio".

Well, this is intentional.

I plan to make it a policy to keep as much of my blog and own infrastructure as open and transparent as possible. Why? I love sharing knowledge and have a passionate dislike of duplication of effort. Further, I think openness and transparency (when applied responsibly) can be a huge force for good. Finally, I don't believe keeping this stuff locked up actually improves security.

If you have any questions, feel free to drop me a line.

PS: If you do see something that you're not sure has been released/published intentionally, please let me know :)
