Welcome to Raptors With Hats. This is Benjamin Arntzen's personal blog.

It's currently under construction and is powered by Jekyll and the Minima theme.

You can find the source code for Minima at GitHub:

An older version of this blog based on OctoPress can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Zorlin/raptorswithhats.com-legacy/). I am in the process of copying posts from it, though not all of them will survive the move.
